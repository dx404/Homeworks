Part 1: Part 1: Textures and Normal Maps
	For the first part, all mesh objects are applied the corresponding textures. 
Some textures are applied according to the normal maps, using bump-specular or 
bump-diffuse, such as the pole inside the building. The scene is lighten by a 
yellow point light at (0,0,0) which is inside the cathedral. The first-person 
controller is walking inside the cathedral. 

Part 2: Shadows and Light Maps
	I selected a simple scene - a teapot over a carpet, using light mapping to 
create the shadows. The light is a blue directional light and the first person 
controller is able to walk around the teapot.
